<p>
If you (the person reading this webpage) have come across a posting about me on Facebook or other social platforms, or possibly have been asked on social media to spy on me, for example to report back the location and time where you saw me, and/or ask me questions, please be aware that such privacy violations are illegal in Canada, and the people behind the requests are criminals who could be prosecuted. I would greatly appreciate if, using the email address provided above, you let me know the details.
</p>

<p>
Publicly sharing personal information without asking consent from the individual is illegal in Canada.
<br>
Privacy is considered to be a fundamental human right. The right to privacy is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Still, it can be difficult for people who take part in spying to see, or to care about, the colossal damage they create in the life of the individual they spy on, or the destructive intensions of the people they are "helping out" by participating in the spying.
</p>


<p>
During a recent (2023) application for EI benefits (I am a Canadian Citizen living in BC), I was asked to justify why I quit a company I had worked for. I informed the government (on the online form) that it was due to privacy violations, and specifically for using the workplace to gather personal information about me for the purpose of sharing it with a third-party.
<br>
These privacy violations have destroyed my work environment with multiple employers I have had since 2019, and it's likely to do so in the future. It has destroyed my financial situation and personal life due to having to quit jobs, being unemployed, and having to move between towns as my only chance of getting a new job.
However, I am still unable to legally pursue the criminals behind it, as the violations to my privacy are done "behind by back" and supposedly without me knowing what has taken place. Those behind it make connections with my coworkers and supervisors in workplaces I go to, give them personal info about me consisting of half truths, false assumptions, and lies, and that they have no business to know, and get them to spy on me at the workplace by asking me personal questions and reporting back with anything they can say about me on the jobsite (whether for financial gains or simply for getting &quot;upvotes&quot; and &quot;love&quot; on social networks, I have no idea).
</p>

<p>
Further, the spying is not limited to my workplaces. Strangers on the street, at grocery stores, Tim Hortons, etc, approach me with personal questions and sometimes seem to use their phones to take videos of me.
</p>

<p>
The result of all that privacy violations and assaults has been the destruction of both my personal and work life.
</p>

<p>
The only way this (i.e. finding the locations of my workplaces and getting supervisors and coworkers to spy on me, and having complete strangers on the street recognize me) can be done, I have no doubt, is through using social media and installing a tracking/spying software on my mobile devices (or at least having access to my location data), of which I have no proof.
<br>
For myself, the people or organization behind the assaults, as well as how they operate, are currently hiding &quot;behind a curtain&quot; and I am unable to see through.

<br><br>
&quot;The suit was brought on behalf of Lyse Beaulieu, a 65-year-old woman who was looking for a new job. She alleges she was never shown employment ads on the social media site, despite being an active user, because advertisers chose to exclude people her age.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;The suit — filed in 2019 when the company known today as Meta Platforms Inc., was still called Facebook — alleges the social media site violated Quebec’s Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms by offering advertisers tools to target housing and employment ads to users based on their age, race and gender and ensuring that people from outside those targeted groups wouldn’t see the ads.&quot;
