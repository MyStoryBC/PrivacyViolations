<h2>
Part 1: Employment Law and Human Rights Violations
</h2>

<p>
<br>
In 2023, during an application for EI benefits, I was asked to justify why I quit a company I had worked for in Squamish, BC. I informed the government (on the online form) that it was due to privacy violations, and specifically for using the workplace to gather personal information about me for the purpose of sharing it with a third-party.
<br>
These privacy violations have destroyed my work environment with six employers I have had since 2019, and it's likely to do so in the future. It has destroyed my financial situation and personal life due to having to quit jobs, being unemployed, and having to move between towns as my only chance of getting a new job.
However, I am still unable to legally pursue the criminals behind it, as the violations to my privacy are done "behind by back" and supposedly without me knowing what has taken place. Those behind it make connections with my coworkers and supervisors in workplaces I go to, give them personal info about me consisting of half truths, false assumptions, and lies, and that they have no business to know, and get them to spy on me at the workplace by asking me personal questions and reporting back with anything they can say about me on the jobsite (whether for financial gains or simply for getting &quot;upvotes&quot; and &quot;love&quot; on social networks, I have no idea). The purpose, or the result, of doing that, has been the destruction of both my personal and work life.
</p>
<p>
Publicly sharing personal information without asking consent from the individual is illegal in Canada.
<br>
Privacy is considered to be a fundamental human right. The right to privacy is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
<br>
Privacy is important, in part because it allows individuals to think, reflect, and express themselves without fear of intrusion or surveillance.
<br>
The prosecution of those responsible for privacy violations can be challenging due to difficulties in gathering evidence as well as getting people who participate to come forward. It's difficult for people who take part in spying to see the colossal damage they create in the life of the individual they spy on, or the destructive intensions of the people they are "helping out" by participating in the spying.

<h2>
Part 3: Using Social Platforms as Destructive Tools 
</h2>
<p>
The only way this (i.e. finding the locations of my workplaces and getting supervisors and coworkers to spy on me) can be done, I have no doubt, is through using social networks and installing a tracking/spying software on my mobile devices (or at least having access to my location data), of which I have no proof.
<br>
For myself, the people or organization behind the assaults, as well as how they operate, are currently hiding &quot;behind a curtain&quot; and I am unable to see through.
<br>
<br>
In addition, there is a connection (alliance) between social networks. During the period of this story (i.e. since 2019):
<br>
<strong>1) Facebbok</strong> &ndash; every post or comment that I have made, regardless of the group or content, has been immediately deleted by admin (for no apparent reason), so I ended up deleting my facebook account.
<br>
<strong>2) LinkedIn</strong> &ndash; my account was terminated by admin for no apparent reason.
<br>
<strong>3) Kolabtree</strong> &ndash; the second-tier jobs/social platform Kolabtree, which I did have an account on, has created a misleading &quot;profile&quot; for me, including typos, without ever asking my permission, and I received many mocking personal emails from their admin until I stopped communicating with them, as they were obviously following the instructions of a third-party.
<br>
<strong>4) Amazon</strong> &ndash; my account was pummelled in stages of increasing severity, all without any obvious reason, other than perhaps an Amazon employee following the instructions of a third-party to assault me through my Amazon account.

Part 4: Recent Related Lawsuits Against Social Media Companies
</h2>

<strong>1) Quebec</strong> (class action)

<br><br>
Quotes from the articles:
<br><br>
&quot;The suit was brought on behalf of Lyse Beaulieu, a 65-year-old woman who was looking for a new job. She alleges she was never shown employment ads on the social media site, despite being an active user, because advertisers chose to exclude people her age.&quot;
<br><br>
&quot;The suit — filed in 2019 when the company known today as Meta Platforms Inc., was still called Facebook — alleges the social media site violated Quebec’s Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms by offering advertisers tools to target housing and employment ads to users based on their age, race and gender and ensuring that people from outside those targeted groups wouldn’t see the ads.&quot;
